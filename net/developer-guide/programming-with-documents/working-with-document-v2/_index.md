The **Document** class is central in AsposeWords. It represents a document and provides various document properties and methods, such as saving or protecting the document. Whatever you want to perform with AsposeWords, for example, create a new document from scratch, open a template for mail merge, get different parts from the document, and so on, you use the **Document** class as the starting point.

A **Document** object contains all content and formatting, styles, built-in and custom properties, and the [MailMerge](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/words/aspose.words.mailmerging/MailMerge) object that is used for a mail merge. **Document** enables you to retrieve text, bookmarks, and form fields for the entire document or separate sections.

**Document** contains a collection of the [Section](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/words/aspose.words/section) objects enabling you to obtain a particular section or perform some manipulations such as copying or moving sections. The **Document** object can be saved at any time to a file or stream and also sent to a client browser.
