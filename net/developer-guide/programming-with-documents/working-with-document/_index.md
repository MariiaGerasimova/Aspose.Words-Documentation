The Document is a central class in Aspose.Words and represents a document and provides various document properties and methods such as saving or protecting the document.

Whatever you want to perform with Aspose.Words: create a new document from scratch, open a template for mail merge, get different parts from the document - use the **Document** class as your starting point. The **Document** object contains all content and formatting, styles, built-in and custom properties, and the [MailMerge](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/words/aspose.words.mailmerging/MailMerge) object that is used for a mail merge.

The **document** allows you to retrieve text, bookmarks and form fields for the whole document or for separate sections. The **document** contains a collection of the [Section](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/words/aspose.words/section) objects so that you can obtain a particular section or do some manipulations like copying or moving sections. The **document** can be saved at any time to a file or stream and also be sent to a client browser.
