Difference between LINQ Reporting Engine and Mail Merge

MG: I think we should make a separate article in comparison with Report generation and LINQ and move it to the end of this section. Because these are separate topics that are not directly related to the work of Mail merge. And while it is not clear why should users read about this at the beginning of the section. In the introduction of this article, you need to give a little explanation about LINQ and Report generation, so that it is clear why we generally compare Mail Merge with them.

[LINQ Reporting Engine](/words/net/linq-reporting-engine/) has many features that aren't supported in mail merge such as the following:

- Use data sources such as objects of .NET types and ADO.NET.
- Use C# syntax and LINQ extension methods directly in templates to access parts of complex objects and to apply data manipulation operations such as filtering, sorting, and grouping.
- Generate a single document using multiple data sources of different types.
- Use .NET custom types to invoke its static and instance members.
- Use [variables](/words/net/template-syntax/#templatesyntax-usingvariables) in template documents.
- Format the expression results.
- Generate dynamic charts.
- Set a dynamic text background color.
- Work with conditional blocks in tables in addition to regular ones (this feature is missing in Mail Merge).

Mail merge functionality is tied with Word fields, limited, not extendable and complex when it's coming to do more complicated operations than referencing a field.
Working with mail merge feature in Aspose.Words is similar to working with Word mail merge. You can use this feature if you have a lot of templates that you do not want or cannot modify them. While LINQ reporting engine syntax is not tied with any Word specific features, extendable, lightweight and gives many features that aren't supported in mail merge. It enables Aspos.Words to add even more new features upon users' requests.
## **Mail Merge vs Report Generation**
MG: Where is the bound between the Mail merge and Report generation?

MG: What about LINQ Reporting Engine? Why is this information at the end of this article? I think we should make a separate article in comparison with Report generation and LINQ and move it to the end of this section. Because these are separate topics that are not directly related to the work of Mail merge. And while it is not clear why should users read about this at the beginning of the section. In the introduction of this article, you need to give a little explanation about LINQ and Report generation, so that it is clear why we generally compare Mail Merge with them.

When the mail merge process is initiated, the recipients' data from a spreadsheet or a database is fetched and placed within the empty field in the letter, one by one, until all letters are created. So, a Mail merge enables you to create documents automatically. This process of automatically creating a document is called report generation.

Report generation can work with multiple data sources and export reports to different document formats. The procedure of getting contact information (name, address, phone number, etc.) from a data source and automatic insertion of this data into letters, mail labels, and other documents, is decreasing in usage. Report generation is now used more to apply any template into a document.
