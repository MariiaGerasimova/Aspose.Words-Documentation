Aspose.Words is a class library that enables your applications to perform a great range of document processing tasks. Aspose.Words is available as two distinct products for .NET and Java. But in addition to building .NET and Java applications, it is possible and often makes a great sense to use Aspose.Words when building applications for other platforms including:

- Windows Azure Platform
- Microsoft SharePoint
- Microsoft Silverlight 
- Mono 
- Xamarin.Android
