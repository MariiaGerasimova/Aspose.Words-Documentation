Using Aspose.Words you can export any loaded document to Macromedia Flash Format (SWF). Using this output you can create your own document viewer for your website by embedding the SWF on your web page.

The output file is embedded with a default viewer which allows the document to be viewed with a high quality graphical interface. The interface provides features such as text search, buttons to zoom in and out and to change the current page. There is an option to include this viewer or not as you may only want to the source document exported on its own.You can also highlight and copy text from the page which adds an extra useful function to the viewer. 

There are many save options avalible to control how the apperance of the graphical interface, such as:

- Enabling or disabling buttons, toolbars, text search box, page border,
- Adding tool tips to GUI elements.
- Adding a logo image.

There are also options to control how the flash file is produced, such as:

- The page range to export.
- Compression to use.
- The JPEG quality to export images with.

Both TrueType and OpenFont font formats are supported during rendering to SWF.
