The screenshots below show the results of converting to EPUB format. Since EPUB is an electronic books publishing format, it is obvious that most import features will include text processing: a wide range of paragraph formatting settings, rendering of complex tables or lists.

In addition to text, it is nessecary to export images which are essential for most publications and which can be aligned differently on the screen.

Aspose.Words also allows to export the table of contents as inline text with working hyperlinks. The same headings which make up the table of contents in the source document are exported to the navigation bar in the EPUB for easy navigation.

## **EPUB File Validation**
[AM: This information is actually relates to supported EPUB import/export features. Do we have such topic?]

[MG: Please see the comment above.]

EPUB documents produced by Aspose.Words pass validation. It means that EPUB standards are respected and there are no errors in the EPUB.Â 
Even though passing validation does not guarantee that each device or EPUB viewer will display your document in exactly the same way, it nevertheless gives the highest chance that your document will be viewed as close as originally intended.

The image below shows the report on the document that we just converted using one of the validation services.

### **Export Metadata to EPUB File**
[MG: What property is used? Is it a public API? We need a code example.]

Document.BuiltInDocumentProperties

Metadata is additional information such as Author Name, Title, Comments, etc., added to a file that is not visible in the content of the file itself. Metadata fields are often required by distributors and e-bookstores as keywords for their search engines and to provide information about books to customers.

Word document formats have special properties dedicated to such metadata, and they also can be exported to EPUB files.

The image below shows the metadata after conversion.
