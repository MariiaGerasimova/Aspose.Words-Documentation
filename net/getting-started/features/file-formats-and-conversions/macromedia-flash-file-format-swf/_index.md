## **About SWF**

|![todo:image_alt_text](macromedia-flash-file-format-swf_1.png)|The Macromedia Flash File Format ([SWF](https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/swf/)) is a popular file format used to display different types of multimedia and vector graphics to the end-user, normally embedded in websites. <br><br>SWF files can contain applets of varying degrees of interactivity and function.|

## **SWF in Aspose.Words**
Using Aspose.Words any supporting document can be converted to SWF and displayed anywhere that a flash file can be displayed, for example on a website or on a mobile phone. As with the PDF and XPS formats, Aspose.Words uses the same high-fidelity rendering engine to produce output in the SWF format. The generated flash file contains an optional built-in viewer allowing any application that can open flash format files to display documents almost identically to how they originally looked in Microsoft Word. 

` `The built-in viewer also presents a flashy UI and allows features such as search and zooming of the document. The document can also be saved without the built-in viewer included so any external viewer can be used to display the document instead. Check out this functionality in action on our demo’s site which is available [here](http://www.aspose.com/demos/.net-components/aspose.words/default.aspx). The images below show how a document can be converted from DOC to an SWF file using Aspose.Words and displayed in a browser or any other flash capable viewer.
